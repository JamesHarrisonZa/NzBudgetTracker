# ğŸ’² New Zealand budget tracker

I spend too much money ğŸ˜¶. I want to save more. This exists to help get closer to the dream of affording a house deposit in New Zealand. ğŸ˜‘

## âš¡ Getting Started

### ğŸ”Œ Akahu details

- Copy/duplicate the `.env.example` and name it `.env.local`
- Add Akahu details to `env.local`. You will need an account. See [here](https://developers.akahu.nz/docs/personal-apps) for more information

### ğŸš€ Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## ğŸ”§ TODO

### Small

- Find good default images for credits/debits

### Medium

- Add pending transactions from Akahu.
- Update stats to compare last month to this month.

### Large

- Set budget goals for categories.
